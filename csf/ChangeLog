	* Change the source code layout, and start the RC test.
	
2008-12-12 [CSF 3.0 RC1]  Avin <zhangshuo@staff.sina.com.cn>
	* fixed a bug of function: free_pipeline_data, which may leads to read NULL pointer.
	* add a parameter of Monitor of csf: MNT_DISREG, which is use to disregister pointers.
	* add a function of response the -HUP signal, which is used to reload the configuration
	  file. the all configuration can be modified except 'port', 'timeout' and 'protocol'.
	  if -HUP signal is responsed, the old protocol and pipeline will work until all old
	  request & thread finished, and at that moment, the new protocol and pipeline has 
	  been at work. this means that your business will not be interrupted.
	* upgrade the csf Monitor module which write in python. the monitor will display 
	  different color on changed digits (red color). this feature needs to be supported
	  by the terminal. there also be a notice that ask you whether switch on the color
	  support which can avoid unexpect characters on the terminal that do not support
	  color transfering characters.
	
	the bugs list below have found but not fixed yet:
	* a bug of conf parser, which may leads to segment fault.
	  please use CONF_ITEM_LEN + 1 to specify the conf value buffer length.
	  
	notice:
	* this is a RC edition, be serious-minded when use -HUP function to re-configure
	  your csf when running a heavy service.
	  there is no problems under my test, but i do not guarantee it's safe absolutely.

	* add internal log support. you can log your message without syslogd for a better
	  performance especially on Linux. And reloading configure file via -HUP is also
	  well supported.
