Welcome to Common Server Framework (CSF) -- version 4.0.0

CSF is a Fast, Scalable, Server Framework which could become many server. 
Likes Web Server, Mail Server, Cache Server, Message Server etc.

Dependencies:
	-- libevent, http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)
	-- pthread, CSF is a Mutli-Threaded Framework, so, your system 
	should support pthread normally. For Linux, you'd better use 
	the NPTL(Native Posix Thread Library), but not LinuxThread.
	For FreeBSD, you'd better use it in FreeBSD 7 or later.



Enjoy!
